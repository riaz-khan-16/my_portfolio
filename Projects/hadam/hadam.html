           The goal of this analysis is to classify normal and abnormal movements. The clue may 
be that while walking through a line the deviation of a key point of a normal person is  

different from an abnormal person. Using this principle we can differentiate normal 
people and abnormal people.

        
        </p>


<p>
    <span style="color:black; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 700;">Possible Solutions:</span>
  We can develop a Machine Learning model which can predict whether a personâ€™s movement is normal or abnormal. To do this we need to do the following steps.
From the video, we will do these tasks:
<ul class="b">
    <li>Calculate the deviation from the white line from every frame of the video</li>
    <li>Make a visualization from the deviation values by graph</li>
    <li>We will collect videos from both normal people and sick people and make and dataset of the deviation graphs</li>
    <li>A Deep learning model can be developed by the dataset.</li>
</ul>

    <span style="color:black; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 700;"> Challenges:</span> <br>
   
    <ul class="b">
<li>Dataset collection</li>
<li> The line detection</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
    <span style="color:black; font-size: 20px; font-weight: 700;">Requirements:</span> <br>

    <ul class="b">

<li>A line should be drawn in the middle of the camera screen.</li>
<li>While capturing the video the line should be matched with the white line on the floor</li>
</ul>

                            This is the full video of the Porject
                            In this video  the raw video is shown at the first part
                            Then How  key points are  generated that is shown.
                            Our main goal for this video is to show how ankle is 
                            deviating from the midline . In the last part of the video
                            I showed how ankle is deviating from midline by using a graph.
                            The graph is generated how is also shown in this video.
                            Therefore it is the total overview of  this project.

               In this figure we have shown the key points of the 
               person. We used simple HRNET to detect the Keypoints
               of the person. Each Key points are colored by different colored
               so that it will be easy to track any keypoint.
