          This project intends to predict the health condition of power transformers using Hybrid developed
          Learning models. Power transformers are critical parts of power delivery systems. So that the maintenance
          of the health of power transformers are very important. We have collected 607 transformer's data
          from Dhaka University of  Engineering and Technology. There were about 31 colomuns for each transformers.
          I set the transformer's health condition as output parameter and the other parameters as input paramters.

    <span style="color:black; font-size: 15px; font-weight: 700;">Training Dataset Making:</span>
    The class of transformer is determined using 32 input parameters. Ten different types of transformers are 
    represented in the training dataset: Three categories: good level-1, good level-2, and good level-3—are 
    used to categorize good transformers. The optimum condition is at good level-1, whereas good level-2 is 
    superior to good level 3. Moderate-1, moderate-2, moderate-3, and moderate-4 are the four classes into 
    which medium-type transformers are separated. Compared to moderate-2, moderate-3, and moderate-4, 
    moderate-1 implies better condition. Similar to that moderate-3 is a better condition than moderate-4.
     Moderate-2 indicates a better state than moderate-3. The three classifications of poor transformers are
     poor level-1, poor level-2, and poor level-3.

    <span style="color:black; font-size: 15px; font-weight: 700;"> Environment Setup</span> <br>
   
    In this project total of 8 models are implemented and evaluated. In the algorithmic implementation,
     the Google Colaboratory software package has been used with the necessary modification and extension. 
     In the experiment, the original database of 607 records is randomly split into two parts of a training 
     dataset and a testing dataset for validating the classification accuracy of the above eight algorithms,
      where 70% of samples of the original dataset are considered for the training dataset and the remaining 
      30% for the testing dataset. It is worth pointing out that the data is scaled to [-1, 1] interval before 
      running any algorithm. The above dataset split, cross-validation, and testing will be repeated 100 times 
      for every algorithm.

                            There were several misclassifications found. The logistic regression model's total classification accuracy was 65.5 percent.
                             This makes it very evident that the suggested framework falls short of high accuracy in the categorization 
                             of disorders.However, the classification accuracy frequently obscures the specifics and does not offer enough proof to claim that
                              a system's forecast is reliable. Another measure, the F1 score, which details the classification performance of certain fault classes,
                               was also used to evaluate the performance.

                          An F1 score of around 1 in a multi-class prediction problem denotes perfect classification performance, while an F1 value 
                          of 0 is the worst. While the recall counts the actual positives detected, the precision shows the proportion of
                           positive identifications. By examining the aforementioned measured performance, it can be concluded that
                            the suggested network categorizes transformers according to their health, but that its overall classification 
                            accuracy is less than 70%.

                     The machine learning classifiers' classification outcomes weren't adequate for the task.
                      However, because a transformer is a crucial component in the transmission and conversion
                       of electricity, it is required to forecast the real class of a transformer. Therefore, 
                       feature extraction was carried out using various autoencoder types in order to produce 
                       reliable prediction results, and the new dataset that was mentioned in the previous study was
                        developed. . The compressed dataset was then classified using machine learning classifiers.

                  As a consequence, integrated models are developed, and these models produce excellent 
                  classification outcomes. Figure [] displays each autoencoder's representation of the classification 
                  results using a confusion matrix for the logistic regression classifier. The combined MLPA/Logistic
                   Regression model produces the best results overall in terms of classification accuracy. The classification
                    accuracy of the combined model made with MLPA and Logistic Regression gives the best results among all
                     the models.

                  Figure no illustrates the training and validation loss of 5 autoencoder models. The training and
                  
                validation loss are often displayed on a graph simultaneously. This is done to evaluate the model's 
                performance and determine which elements require fine-tuning. Three distinct situations must be detailed 
                in order to clarify this. The validation loss sometimes exceeds the training loss.

                  This might mean that the model is not fitting the data well. When a model is unable to effectively 
                  represent the training set of data, underfitting occurs and huge mistakes are produced. The model is 
                  overfitting and unable to generalize to new data if the validation loss is higher than the training loss.
